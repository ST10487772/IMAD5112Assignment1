Meal Suggestion App (Kwa Mnathos)
The Meal Suggestion App is an android application that I deigned to suggest meals based on the time of day entered by the user.
It has a user-friendly interface for inputting the time of day and reciving a corresponding meal suggestion.
This app provides meal suggestions based on different times of the day.

There's a text box where the users can enter the time of day ("Morning, Mid-Morning, Afternoon, Mid-Afternoon, Dinner).
The Display Suggestion, displays the relevant meal suggestions based on user input.
Then there's an Error Handling that provides feedback if an invlid input is entered.
Then there's Reset Button that clears the textbox and output are. 
I used the programming lnguage called Kotlin to write the code on Android Studio.
